This week we were able to research and write some code regarding the encryption and decryption process. 
This process uses many different gates that allows it to do processes like rotating, adding, and subtracting. 
The decryption process is the same as the encryption process but it is in reverse. We have fully yet to test our code but have started it. 
We are having trouble finding more research information that could help us further our understanding of the project and could be useful to help us write more of the code.
